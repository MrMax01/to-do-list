## Description
Once you write the to-do with the date, it gets listed below and saved in localStorage.
- Pressing the 'Enter' key or clicking 'add' adds the to-do to the list.
- by clicking on 'delete' it will be removed from the list and from the localStorage. <br>

*I used an object array with name, date, time attributes to save the list.*
